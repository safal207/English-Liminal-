emotional_arc: |
  You begin with discovery, learning to ask powerful questions that uncover
  pain points. Through product demos, you learn to tell stories that sell.
  When prospects push back with objections, you learn to reframe concerns
  as opportunities. Finally, negotiation and closing teach you to advocate
  for value while building trust. By the end, sales feels like service,
  not selling.

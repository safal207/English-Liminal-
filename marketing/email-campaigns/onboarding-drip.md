**Preview Text:** Real story. Real results.

**Body:**

[First Name],

Meet Alex.

6 months ago, he was terrified of pitching his startup to investors in English.

"I had the idea. I had the product. But I couldn't SELL it in English."

**Then he found English Liminal.**

He practiced the **Investor Pitch** scenario 5 times.

2 weeks later: First investor meeting.

Result: **€500K pre-seed round.**

Here's what he told us:

> "The scenario taught me not just WHAT to say, but HOW to say it with confidence. I sounded like I belonged in that room."

**Your turn.**

What scenario could change YOUR life?

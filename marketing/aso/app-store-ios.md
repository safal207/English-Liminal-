### Hook (First 2 lines - visible without "more")
Stop studying grammar. Start living English.

English Liminal teaches you real-world English through immersive role-playing scenarios. Not flashcards. Not grammar drills. Real conversations that matter.

### The Problem
Traditional language apps teach you vocabulary you'll never use. You memorize "the cat sits on the mat" but freeze when ordering coffee abroad, giving a presentation, or negotiating a salary.

### The Solution
English Liminal drops you into **real-life situations** where English actually matters:

• **Interview at a foreign tech company**
  Practice technical communication and professional diplomacy

• **Pitch your startup to investors**
  Master persuasive English for fundraising and networking

• **Navigate visa applications and border crossings**
  Build confidence in high-stakes official conversations

• **Lead a remote development team**
  Learn async communication and code review etiquette

• **Close enterprise sales deals**
  Master SPIN selling, objection handling, and negotiation

• **Raise a family abroad**
  Communicate with teachers and build community

### How It Works

**7 Immersive Roles**
Choose scenarios that match your life: QA Engineer, Startup Founder, Sales Professional, Remote Developer, Global Citizen, Visa Journey, or Family Abroad.

**26 Real-World Scenarios**
From investor pitches to kindergarten pickups. Each scenario teaches you phrases that actually matter.

**4 Learning Steps**
• **Listen** - Hear native speakers in context
• **Speak** - Practice with speech recognition
• **Contrast** - Learn what sounds professional vs. awkward
• **Apply** - Use it in your own life immediately

**Spaced Repetition**
Never forget what you learn. Our adaptive algorithm brings back phrases right when you need them.
